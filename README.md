# What is Kaniop?

Kaniop is an open source **cloud-native identity management orchestrator** for Kubernetes, providing
the platform, framework, and support for [Kanidm](https://kanidm.com) identity services to natively
integrate with Kubernetes.

[Kanidm](https://kanidm.com) is a modern, secure identity management system that provides
authentication and authorization services with support for POSIX accounts, OAuth2, and more.

Kaniop automates deployment and management of Kanidm clusters to provide self-managing,
self-scaling, and self-healing identity services. The Kaniop operator does this by building on
Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Kanidm clusters.

The operator enables **declarative identity management** through GitOps workflows, allowing you to
manage users, groups, OAuth2 clients, and other identity resources using familiar Kubernetes
manifests.

Key capabilities include:

- **Kanidm Cluster Management**: Deploy and manage high-availability Kanidm clusters with automatic
  replication
- **Identity Resources**: Declaratively manage persons, groups, OAuth2 clients, and POSIX accounts
- **GitOps Ready**: Full integration with Git-based workflows for infrastructure-as-code
- **Kubernetes Native**: Built using Custom Resources and standard Kubernetes patterns
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, monitoring, and observability features
