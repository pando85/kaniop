## Webhook
##
## The validating webhook prevents creating Kanidm custom resources that would conflict
## with existing objects in the same Kanidm cluster. In short, it rejects CREATE requests
## when another resource with the same name already points at the same Kanidm cluster
## (kanidmRef.name + kanidmRef.namespace). This avoids duplicate entries being managed by
## different Kubernetes namespaces or CRs that could otherwise collide inside Kanidm.
##
## The webhook runs as a separate deployment and exposes an HTTPS server backed by
## a TLS certificate. You can configure certificate management using the built-in
## `certManager` support (injects CA with cert-manager), or use the built-in certificate
## generation job that creates a long-lived certificate at helm install time.
